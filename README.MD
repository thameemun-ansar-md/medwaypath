# MEDWAYPATH Documentation

## Introduction

This project follows an API-first design approach, where the API contract is defined before implementing the backend logic. This approach ensures clear communication between stakeholders, promotes a consistent API design, and facilitates collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

## API Definition

The API contract is defined using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) version X.X.X. The OpenAPI Specification is a widely adopted industry standard for describing RESTful APIs.

The API specification file is located at [medwaypath-specifications/src/main/resources]. This folder contains detailed documentation of all API endpoints, request/response schemas, parameters, and example usage.

## Tools Used

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/): Used to generate server stubs and client SDKs from the OpenAPI specification file.
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/): Used for editing and validating the OpenAPI specification file. It provides real-time feedback on the validity and structure of the API contract.
